# Telecom_Receiver
A project simulating the spectrum of every operation performed in a hypereterodyne receiver
-Open the following files through pycharm
-Click run and a menu will open
-In order to see the spectrum through every stage you should initiaze the frequency of the oscillator and define the bandwith of the RF filter.Notice that frequency is in Hz and you cannot enter a frequency higher than 1MHz. Also consider that we are performing HSI so fl=fif+fc that means in order to work properly you cannot enter a frequency in the oscillator higher than the signal frequency
-Click insert one signal (witch in a cosine) and define the frequency and the amplitude
-Then you can click spectrum in order to see the analytic spectrum through every stage of the receiver
-You can also adjust signal to your initial signal (cosines) in different frequencies and different amplitudes.Then you can also click spectrum to see the analytic spectrum
